**Unit 6: Comparing Ideology, Policy, and Decision Making** <span
id="6"></span> 
*This unit deals with ideology and decision-making tactics.  We first
compare five different ideologies that shape mainstream political party
platforms and governance in contemporary democratic systems
(conservatism, liberalism, Christian democracy, social democracy, and
environmentalism).   We then look at frameworks for understanding the
policy process before discussing the ways in which policymakers garner
feedback and use indecision strategically. The unit concludes with a
focus on informal influences that shape government policy choices.*
