**Unit 3: Democratic States and Democratization** <span id="3"></span> 
*Unit 3 focuses exclusively on the concept of democracy.  After defining
the concept, this unit focuses on various attributes that characterize
democratic states and differentiate them from authoritarian regimes.  We
then examine processes of democratization and the breakdown of democracy
followed by the  debate regarding the relationship between democracy and
economic development.  The unit concludes with a focus on the
contemporary case of the Arab Spring.  
    
 As you work through unit 3, reflect on the following questions. What
differentiates democracies from authoritative regimes? What conditions
facilitate democratization and do contemporary trends in the early
21<sup>st</sup> century support or undermine democratic states? 
Finally, are those who argue that democracy improves economic outcomes
correct in their analysis?*

     Instructions: Please watch the first seven parts of Oliver
    Ressler’s 8-part film.  This video illustrates the ongoing conflict
    between the ideal/normative definition and the real/empirical
    definition of democracy.  A pure democracy would be one in which
    each citizen has an equal impact on his or her own governance. 
    Though a pure democracy has never existed, governments have been
    constitutionally designed to identify who is permitted to speak and
    count based on democratic principles.  You will learn that many
    countries bear the official title of a Democratic Republic—meaning
    that they strive toward democracy, but have a Republican form of
    representative government in which one or multiple layers of
    leadership speak for the people.  Note that this video covers
    subunits 3.1.3.1-3.1.3.3.
