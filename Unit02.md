**Unit 2: The Nation-State** <span id="2"></span> 
*As introduced in Unit 1,comparative politics enables us to understand
how and why nations change, how and why governments in a particular part
of the world compare to governments in a different part of the world,
and other patterns and regularities between political systems.  Before
we can begin our work as comparatists, however, we need to learn about
the basic unit of comparative political study: the state (or
nation-state). In Unit 2, we first examine the history and thinking
behind the modern nation state through the contributions of Hobbes and
Weber. We will then discuss how states developed in our modern world,
challenges to state sovereignty, the psychology of the modern
nation-state, and compare totalitarian and authoritarian forms of the
state.   
  
 As you read through unit 2, reflect on the following questions. Why do
we have or need the nation- state?  How does the concept of sovereignty
tie into the history and characteristics of the state?  How has the
nation-state evolved since its origin in 1648?  Is there an optimum form
of state rule? And finally, is the modern nation state static or
evolving in its form and function?*
