Course Syllabus for "POLSC221: Introduction to Comparative Politics"
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Like it or not, we can’t escape politics.  Politics, a term best defined
as the distribution, exercise, and consequences of power, exists at
multiple levels in our society and in our daily lives.  We experience
politics in action, for example, in international negotiations,
government policy choices, our workplace, and even in our own families. 
This course focuses its efforts on exploring the formal, public sphere
of politics and power relations through a systematic study and
comparison of types of government and political systems. Comparatists
(practitioners of comparative politics) seek to identify and understand
the similarities and differences between these systems by taking broad
topics—say, for example, “democracy” or “freedom”—and breaking them down
into factors that can be found in individual systems.  We call this
general approach “the comparative method.”  The goal of the comparative
method is to identify the factors and/or categories of analysis to
effectively compare and contrast different political phenomena.  Using
the comparative method, we can tackle broader, more complicated
questions like: Are certain forms of representative democracy more
effective than others?  Why are some countries extremely prosperous,
while others are extremely poor?  How does the degree of authoritarian
control by a government drive economic development?  Does culture impact
quality of governance? The course proceeds as follows: Unit 1 introduces
basic concepts in social science, comparative political theory, and
methodology.  Unit 2 examines the state and compares  authoritarian,
totalitarian, and democratic state forms.  Unit 3 focuses on the concept
of democracy and democratization.  Unit 4 explores institutional
features of government and governance.  Unit 5 moves outside the realm
of government structure to explore how variables including culture,
interest groups, pressure groups, lobbying, the press, media campaigns,
nongovernmental and quasi-nongovernmental organizations shape outcomes
in politics.  Unit 6 compares different ideologies and government policy
processes.  In Unit 7, we apply comparative methods to examine
variations of government structure and economic development across four
different regions of the world: the Americas, Africa, Asia, and the
Middle East.  Upon successful completion of the course, you will have
the methodological background to understand and explain variations in
political behavior and political institutions.  You will also have a
general understanding of the issues facing political systems in each of
the regions covered. This course is designed to align with a Thomas
Edison State College TECEP examination. Visit the [TECEP
