**Unit 7: Comparative Case Studies** <span id="7"></span> 
*This last unit will introduce you to area studies as they are conducted
in political science and international studies.  Please bear in mind
that this unit is by no means exhaustive either geographically or
topically.  Over the course of this unit, we will apply factor analysis
and other comparative methods we learned in earlier units to practical
examples from 4different regions of the world  (Africa, the Americas,
Asia, and the Middle East).   The classification for such area studies
have developed out of the standard geopolitical organization of American
political science.  For instance, Asian politics is often divided into
East, South, Southeast, and Central Asia sub-fields.  Likewise,
political scientists often divide Africa into the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) and sub-Saharan Africa.  This unit will also look at how
political elites and policy makers hold distinct views on
democratization and modernization and how those views impact political
conflict in these regions.  *

    is a growing argument that the solution must come from within
    Africa.

    Instructions: Read the above assignment. The Argentinean political
    scientist Guillermo O’Donnell has compared Brazil and Argentina in
    the 1960s to explain bureaucratic-authoritarianism emerging at that
    time. Drawing on dependency theory (which assumes that resources
    will flow from poorer peripheral nations to wealthier core nations),
    he argues that dependent development in Latin America had led to
    sharpening class cleavages within Latin American countries. This
    explains both the dictatorships of the 1960s and 1970s as well as
    the growth of a technocratic elite that had emerged as a result of
    state-led industrialization. In Latin America, modernization has led
    to increasingly repressive governments. The rise in the popularity
    of socialist and revolutionary military movements is the result of
    backlash against the technocratic elite.

    scientist Samuel Huntington has criticized the idea that
    technological and political modernization leads to democracy.  He
    believes that an impending “clash of civilizations” will demonstrate
    that education, mass communication, and urbanization may lead us to
    be politically active—and not in a democratic way.  Using this
    framework, he concludes that modernization may actually lead to
    political disenchantment amongst the citizens of industrialized
    countries.  In response, he calls for strong political institutions
    that will channel or suppress demands.
