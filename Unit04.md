**Unit 4: Comparing Political Structures and Institutions** <span
id="4"></span> 
*Constitutions are road maps for political systems.  They are an
expression of collective values, and they enable developing institutions
to begin to maintain security and stability.  Constitutions define
political leadership, modes of representation, a legal framework, and
the limits of a government's power.  Though constitutions vary from
state to state, they also have many similarities.  In this unit, we will
look at how those similarities have emerged to serve common needs.  We
will also consider the ways in which differences between constitutions
reflect the varying values and interests of diverse constituencies.  For
instance, legislatures may be divided into different types of houses and
may have different rules for selecting their members, but they typically
have the same lawmaking purpose.  We will see that these similarities
and differences can be traced to specific reasons that enable us to
better understand a given culture or society.  For example, the way in
which a government is organized often reflects the social stratification
of the political community in question.   
  
 This unit looks at each characteristic of government as a factor to be
used in a comparative study of different governments.  These factors are
derived from not only the written constitution, but the types of
political leadership and bureaucracy that have emerged in a society over
time.  In each case, we will discuss political factors with an eye
toward comparison.  We will identify the degree of bureaucratic
privatization in a given system, discuss how the geography of a society
determines the ways in which different levels of government interact,
ask why certain governments tend towards immobilization in their
policy-making, and explore how each of these factors leads to patterns
in the political process over time. *

     Instructions: On a piece of paper, make headings across the top: 1)
    country, 2) total employment, and 3) public employment.  Select the
    above link and under the Statistics by topic subheading click on
    Employment heading then choose Public Sector Employment.  Once on
    that page, select 2 countries—1 developed and 1 developing, and
    press Go to formulate your data.  View your data by clicking the
    Your data selection box that appears.  View the tables for “Public
    sector employment by type of institution and level of government,
    total and private employment ”in order to compare their total
    employment with their public employment.  Can you figure what
    percentage of total employment is public employment?  In what
    direction is the trend from 1999-2008 going?  “Public employment as
    a percentage of total employment” is a ratio that is a common factor
    in political analysis.  It tells us how big a government is relative
    to the country's economy and how “socialized” the political system
    has become.  This factor can be read as an indicator of either
    social welfare or “immobilism,” a prolonged period of slow economic
    growth.
