**Unit 1: Social Science and Comparative Politics** <span
id="1"></span> 
*Effective comparative study of political systems is rooted in the
scientific method.  To start off the course, Unit 1 first provides an
overview and brief history of scientific inquiry and research methods. 
We then build on these themes as we focus on the comparative method and
outline several “positivist” models of comparison employed by political
scientists.   
  
 As you review the material, think about if and how the comparative
scientific study of politics differs from scientific inquiry focused on
natural phenomena.  Can we study politics, for example, using the same
research methods as a scientist studying microbes or global climate
change?  Why or why not?  Also, should a study of comparative politics
be objectively focused on understanding the world “as it is” or should
it seek to derive better political models and outcomes?  *

    Is Political Science?” and “Social Science Research PowerPoint”**

    Political
    Science?”](http://resources.saylor.org/POLSC/POLSC221/POLSC221-1.2.3-WhatIsPoliticalScience-CCBYNCSA.pdf)

    (PDF)  
        
     Instructions: Read these lecture notes and the PowerPoint slides.
    Pay close attention to slides 5 and 6. Note that the study of
    comparative politics is non-experimental. Also note that there are
    various methods that fall under the non-experimental category. Be
    sure you can distinguish between cases studies, systematic
    comparisons, and cross sectional analysis.

      
     Reading these selections should take approximately 20 minutes.
