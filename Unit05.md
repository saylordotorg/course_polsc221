**Unit 5: Political Behavior** <span id="5"></span> 
*The behaviors of different populations influence, and are influenced
by, political institutions.  This unit focuses on how other (i.e.
non-institutional) factors affect political prospects in different
societies.  
 Culture is defined as the sum of the ideas, values, beliefs, and norms
that inform the ways in which you behave and lead you to anticipate how
you will be judged for your behavior.  We will see that cultural factors
influence the political process in many different ways, often leading to
different political values, differing degrees of alienation from the
local process, and different means of mobilization.  We will also
examine how subcultures and recent shifts in political activism have
influenced government of late before taking a look at interest groups,
pressure groups, lobbying, the press, media campaigns, and
nongovernmental and quasi-nongovernmental organizations.  In these
discussions, we will emphasize the use of the Internet in policy and
administrative processes.  Note that as we progress through this unit,
we will discuss each of these topics in terms of their application in
comparative politics.  Finally, we will conclude with an introduction to
comparative voting processes.*
